# PSBackup

The file in the repository are a collection of PowerShell scripts and functions that I use to backup critical files and folders. The code in this repository is not a PowerShell module that you can download and install. The scripts and functions are written to my specific requirements, but I have had requests to make the code more readily available. You are welcome to use anything in the repository as reference material for your projects, but everything is offered **as-is** with no guarantees** any of the code will work for you.

You can read more about the code in these blog posts.
