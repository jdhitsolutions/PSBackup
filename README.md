# PSBackup

![data](assets/db.png) This repository is a collection of PowerShell scripts and functions that I use to back up critical files and folders on my primary desktop. The code in this repository is **not** a PowerShell module that you can download and install. The scripts and functions are written to my specific requirements, but I have had requests to make the code more readily available. You are welcome to use anything in the repository as reference material for your projects. However, everything is offered **as-is** with **no guarantees** that any of the material will work for you.

> **There are many hard-coded paths unique to my environment. This is normally not a best practice.**

You can read more about the code in these blog posts.
